# Employee Attrition Analysis

This project analyzes employee attrition (employee turnover) within a company using a dataset. The goal is to identify factors contributing to employee attrition and build a machine learning model to predict it.

## Overview

- **Objective**: Understand the factors that contribute to employee attrition and predict the likelihood of employees leaving the company.
- **Dataset**: A dataset containing information about employees, including features such as age, job role, and work-life balance.

## Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python**: The programming language used for data analysis and modeling.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Seaborn** & **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating machine learning models.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/employee-attrition-analysis.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`employee_attrition_analysis.ipynb`) to view the analysis and results.


## Key Insights

- **Factors Contributing to Attrition**: Important factors like age, job role, and work-life balance were identified as significant predictors of employee attrition.
- **Model Performance**: Logistic Regression was used to predict employee attrition. The model's accuracy and other metrics were evaluated.
